# OpenDR Toolkit
Open Deep Learning Toolkit for Robotics


The aim of [OpenDR Project](https://opendr.eu) is to develop a modular, open and non-proprietary toolkit for core robotic functionalities by harnessing deep learning to provide advanced perception and cognition capabilities, meeting in this way the general requirements of robotics applications in the applications areas of healthcare, agri-food and agile production. 
The term toolkit in OpenDR refers to a set of deep learning software functions, packages and utilities used to help roboticists to develop and test a robotic application that incorporates deep learning.
OpenDR provides the means to link the robotics applications to software libraries (deep learning frameworks, e.g., [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and to link it with the operating environment ([ROS](https://www.ros.org/)). 
OpenDR focuses on the AI and Cognition core technology in order to provide tools that make robotic systems cognitive, giving them the ability to a) interact with people and environments by developing deep learning methods for human centric and environment active perception and cognition, b) learn and categorise by developing deep learning tools for training and inference in common robotics settings, and c) make decisions and derive knowledge by developing deep learning tools for cognitive robot action and decision making.
As a result, the developed OpenDR toolkit will also enable cooperative human-robot interaction as well as the development of cognitive mechatronics where sensing and actuation are closely coupled with cognitive systems thus contributing to another two core technologies beyond AI and Cognition. 
OpenDR aims to develop, train, deploy and evaluate deep learning models that improve the technical capabilities of the core technologies beyond the current state of the art. 

## Installing OpenDR Toolkit

OpenDR can be installed in the following ways:
1. By cloning this repository (CPU/GPU support)
2. Using *pip* (CPU only)
3. Using *docker* (CPU only)

You can find detailed installation instruction in the [documentation](?).

## Using OpenDR toolkit
OpenDR provides an intuitive and easy to use [Python interface](?), a [C API](?) for performance critical application, a wealth of [usage examples and supporting tools](?), as well as ready-to-use [ROS nodes](?).
OpenDR is built to support [Webots Open Source Robot Simulator](https://cyberbotics.com/), while it also extensively follows industry standards, such as [ONNX model format](https://onnx.ai/) and [OpenAI Gym Interface](https://gym.openai.com/). 
You can find detailed documentation in OpenDR [wiki](?), as well as in the [tools index](?).

## Roadmap

OpenDR has the following roadmap:
- v1.0 (2021): Baseline deep learning tools for core robotic functionalities
- v2.0 (2022): Optimized lightweight and high-resolution deep learning tools for robotics
- v3.0 (2023): Active perception-enabled deep learning tools for improved robotic perception

## How to contribute
Please follow the instructions provided in the [wiki](?).
